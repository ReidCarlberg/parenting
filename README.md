Parenting
=========

My young son and I were talking about what I do for a living.  I created this by way of illustration.


Installing
==========

```
npm install parenting
```


Example Node.js App
==================

```
var parenting = require("parenting");
parenting.config.child = "Jessica";
parenting.config.auto = true;
parenting.start();
```
